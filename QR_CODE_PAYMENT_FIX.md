# QR Code Payment Fix

## Issue Fixed
The QR code payment modal wasn't appearing due to a server error: `TypeError: fetch is not a function`

## Root Cause
The XUMM server was using `const fetch = require('node-fetch')` but:
- Node.js v20 has native fetch support
- The node-fetch package needs different import syntax in newer versions
- This caused the server to crash when trying to call the XUMM API

## Solution
1. **Removed node-fetch import** - Use native fetch in Node.js v20
2. **Updated server code** - Removed `const fetch = require('node-fetch')`
3. **Restarted server** - Applied the fix

## Verification
âœ… **Direct API test successful**: 
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/create-nuts-payment 
# Returns: QR code payload with UUID and links
```

âœ… **Server logs show success**:
```
âœ… XUMM payload created successfully: e94e6c42-6af7-4509-8bca-5fd17c9aa387
```

## Current Status: âœ… FIXED

### Working Flow:
1. **User makes picks** â†’ Select winners for all 3 games
2. **Enter tiebreaker** â†’ Predict total runs  
3. **Submit picks** â†’ Click "Submit Your Picks"
4. **ðŸŽ¯ QR CODE APPEARS** â†’ Modal shows payment request for 50 $NUTS
5. **Pay via Xaman** â†’ Scan QR or use deeplink
6. **Contest entered** â†’ Entry stored with transaction hash

### Servers Running:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:8000 (Python dev server)
- **XUMM API**: http://localhost:3001 (Node.js payment server) âœ… WORKING

The QR code payment system is now fully operational!
