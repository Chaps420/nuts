# Payment Flow Restoration

## Changes Made
Reverted the wallet connection requirement and restored the original **"payment-on-submission"** flow.

## What Was Removed

### 1. Wallet Connection UI Section
- Removed the entire wallet connection section from `daily-contest.html`
- No more "Connect Wallet" button
- No more wallet status display

### 2. Wallet Connection Logic  
- Removed `handleWalletConnection()` method
- Removed `onWalletConnected()` / `onWalletDisconnected()` methods
- Removed `updateWalletUI()` and `updateContestStatus()` methods
- Removed wallet connection event listeners

### 3. Script Dependencies
- Removed `xaman-wallet.js` script (no longer needed)
- Kept `xaman-payment-api.js` for payment processing

## Current Flow âœ…

### Simple Contest Entry Process:
1. **Browse upcoming games** â†’ Multi-day tabs show all available contests
2. **Make picks** â†’ Click team buttons to select winners for all games  
3. **Enter tiebreaker** â†’ Predict total runs in the last game
4. **Submit picks** â†’ Click "Submit Your Picks" button
5. **ðŸ’³ Payment QR appears** â†’ `window.xamanPayment.createContestPayment()` shows QR modal
6. **Pay with Xaman** â†’ Scan QR or use deeplink to pay 50 $NUTS
7. **Contest entered** â†’ Entry stored in Firebase with transaction hash

### Key Benefits:
- âœ… **No wallet connection required upfront**
- âœ… **Simpler user experience** 
- âœ… **Payment happens only when submitting**
- âœ… **Works on all devices** (QR + deeplink)
- âœ… **Multi-day contest support maintained**

## Payment Integration
The payment system uses:
- **`xaman-payment-api.js`** â†’ Creates XUMM payment requests
- **QR Code Modal** â†’ Shows QR + deeplink for 50 $NUTS payment
- **Transaction tracking** â†’ Stores txHash with contest entry

## Status: âœ… RESTORED
The original payment flow is now restored. Users can make picks and pay when they submit, without needing to connect wallet first.
