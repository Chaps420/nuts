## 🔧 Key Technical Changes Made

### `src/js/daily-contest-new.js`:
```javascript
// NEW: Load ALL games if no admin selection
async loadContestForDay(dayIndex) {
    // First try admin-selected games
    let games = this.loadAdminSelectedGamesForDay(contestDay.dateString);
    
    if (!games || games.length === 0) {
        // Fallback: Load ALL available games for this day
        games = await this.loadMLBGamesForDay(contestDay.date);
    }
    // ... rest of logic
}

// NEW: Wallet connection checks  
setupGameEventListeners() {
    // Check if contest is closed before allowing picks
    if (this.isContestClosed()) {
        this.showError('Contest deadline has passed...');
        return;
    }
    // ... rest of logic
}
```

### `daily-contest.html`:
```html
<!-- NEW: Wallet Connection Section -->
<div class="wallet-connection-section">
    <button id="connect-wallet-btn">Connect Wallet</button>
    <div id="wallet-info" class="hidden">✅ Wallet Connected</div>
</div>
```

The main game now allows users to:
- 🎯 Make picks for games on any upcoming day
